Business Problem-Schuster, a global sports retail corporation, faces challenges with vendors frequently delaying payments, 
impacting business relationships and operational efficiency. To address this, Schuster uses data analytics to understand vendor payment behaviors 
and predict late payment probabilities. By analyzing past payment patterns and forecasting potential delays, Schuster can prioritize follow-ups,
minimize non-value-added activities, and foster healthier vendor relationships. ``

Goal --
Schuster would like to better understand the customersâ€™ payment behaviour based on their past payment patterns (customer segmentation).
Using historical information, it wants to be able to predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from its customers.
It wants to use this information so that collectors can prioritise their work in following up with customers beforehand to get the payments on time.
To summarise, as a business analyst, you want to find the answer to these questions:

How can we analyse the customer transactions data to find different payment behaviours?
In which way can you segregate the customers based on their previous payment patterns/behaviours?
Based on the historical data, can you predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from the customers?
Can you draw any business insights based on your developed model?


Overall, you need to build a model with the primary objective of identifying important predictor attributes that will help the business understand indicators of late payment. You have to recommend the classification model that you would finally deploy for production and explain why you recommend it.
